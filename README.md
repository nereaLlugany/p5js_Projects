# p5js_Projects
There are three types of projects in this repository. The first one, is a new version of how I would create a watch/ another way of representing the time where the estars/circles starts moving each 5 minutes and when the hour changes it changes in one of the 12 zodiac signs. The second one, is a game that you will only need the space kaÂ¡ey of your keyboard to play. Finally, the third one, is a data viwer where you can select different modes you want to see the data gotten from a JSON.
